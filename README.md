# mineflayer bots
this is where ill post my mineflayer bots

if your wondering what mineflayer is

https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer

yea its pretty cool

also i actually suck at this and the code might suck 

as for actually running the bots you have to have node 
https://nodejs.org/en/

 then your gonna want to run
 
 npm i mineflayer
 
 npm i mineflayer-pvp
 
 npm i mineflayer-pathfinder
 
 npm i mineflayer-armor-manager

then the syntax for most of my bot is as follows:

node filename.js ip port name password (password only applies if its a online server if its not then just leave it blank)

thats it

report issues and stuff to Eyeball#7484 on discord
